                <h4>Useful is forever</h4>


                <p>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We
                build useful software that does just what you need and nothing
                you don't.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
                <h3>2</h3>


                <h4>Great service is everything</h4>


                <p>We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work
                hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See
                how our customers rate our service.</p>

                <h4>Clarity is king</h4>


                <p>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized
                sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We
                communicate clearly and honestly.</p>

                <p>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our
                products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market,
                or a board of directors.</p>

                <h4>The basics are beautiful</h4>


                <p>We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great
                service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our
                customer's time, money, and trust.</p>

                <p>We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can
                offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and
                the same no matter who you are.</p>

                <h4>Software should be easy</h4>


                <p>Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds
                or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you
                training because you don't need it.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>8</h3>


                <h4>Long-term contracts are obscene</h4>


                <p>No one likes being locked into something they don't want
                anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions
                asked. No setup/termination fees either.</p>
